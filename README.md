## Idea project

The page allows you to search for albums of the artist that you specify. To start you need enter the artist name and then click in the search button, after that you can see an list of all albums found with the iTunes API. Each card in the list contains: the album cover image, the name of album, the artist name and its price how you see below:

Furthermore, the page has pagination so the list is distribuited in pages with 20 cards each one, but you also have the possibility of see all elements clicking in the button `SEE ALL >`.
